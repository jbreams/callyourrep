			<p>In order to make sure as many people can call their rep as possible, you can only call your
				reps for 20 minutes each per day. The counter below shows how much time you have left! Use
				it well!</p>
			<h1 align=center>{{timer.mins}} minutes, {{timer.secs}} seconds</h1>
			<h4>Be nice!!</h4>
			<p>Remember that you're talking to a staff member or possibly even an intern whose job is to
				answer phone calls! Please be respectful and polite!</p>
